# MediaPipePose-Estimation
## Overview
One of the applications BlazePose can enable is fitness. More specifically - pose classification and repetition counting. In this section weâ€™ll provide basic guidance on building a custom pose classifier with the help of Colabs and wrap it in a simple fitness demo within ML Kit quickstart app. Push-ups and squats are used for demonstration purposes as the most common exercises.
